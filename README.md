# Modern Javascript

Demonstrations of new Javascript features and techniques to make code easier and more powerful.

## Intro

For a long time, the Javascript language seemed very static. ECMAScript 3 was released in 1999, and we wouldn't see a new version for 10 years. Browsers varied wildly in capabilities (IE7, anyone?).  ES5 came out in 2009 and was an improvement, but it wasn't until 2015 that we got ECMAScript 2015 and then in 2016 they started yearly updates via the [TC39 proposal process](https://tc39.es/process-document/).

With Javascript moving so quickly there are a lot of new features available in the last few years that already have wide support among browsers. Most, if not all, of the features mentioned here are already available in modern browsers without transpilation.
